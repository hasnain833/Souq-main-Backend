# Order Shipped Email Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds automatic email notifications to buyers when a seller marks their order as "shipped" in the SOUQ platform. The email includes order details, tracking information (if provided), and links to view the order.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:

1. **`backend/utils/orderShippedEmailTemplate.js`**
   - HTML email template for order shipped notifications
   - Responsive design matching SOUQ branding
   - Supports both tracked and non-tracked shipments
   - Includes order details, tracking info, and call-to-action buttons

2. **`backend/services/OrderEmailService.js`**
   - Service class for handling order-related email notifications
   - `sendOrderShippedEmail()` method for shipping notifications
   - Placeholder for future order email types (delivered, etc.)
   - Proper error handling and logging

3. **`backend/test-order-shipped-email.js`**
   - Test script to verify email functionality
   - Tests both tracked and non-tracked shipments
   - Useful for development and debugging

### Modified Files:

1. **`backend/app/user/shipping/controllers/orderController.js`**
   - Added import for `OrderEmailService`
   - Enhanced the `updateOrderStatus` method to send emails when status changes to "shipped"
   - Integrated with existing notification system
   - Passes shipping details (tracking number, carrier, estimated delivery) to email service

## How It Works

### Backend Flow:
1. Seller marks order as "shipped" via the frontend interface
2. Frontend sends PUT request to `/api/user/orders/:orderId/status` with:
   - `status: "shipped"`
   - `shippingDetails: { trackingNumber, provider, estimatedDelivery }`
   - `notes: "Optional notes"`

3. Backend `updateOrderStatus` method:
   - Updates order status in database
   - Sends in-app notification (existing functionality)
   - **NEW**: Sends email notification to buyer using `OrderEmailService`

4. Email service:
   - Generates HTML email using the template
   - Includes order details and tracking information
   - Sends email via existing `sendMail` utility
   - Handles both real email sending and simulation (for development)

### Frontend Integration:
The frontend already has the necessary components:
- `StandardTransactionManager.jsx` - Handles order status updates for sellers
- `ShippingService.js` - API service that sends shipping details to backend
- Shipping form collects: tracking number, provider, estimated delivery date

## Email Template Features

### Design:
- Responsive HTML email template
- SOUQ branding and colors (#0f766e)
- Professional layout with clear sections
- Mobile-friendly design

### Content Sections:
1. **Header** - SOUQ logo and branding
2. **Main Message** - Personalized greeting and shipping confirmation
3. **Order Details Box** - Order number, product title, seller name
4. **Tracking Information Box** (if available) - Tracking number, carrier, estimated delivery
5. **Instructions** - How to track package and confirm delivery
6. **Call-to-Action** - Button to view order details
7. **Footer** - Help links and copyright

### Dynamic Content:
- Buyer's name personalization
- Order number and product details
- Seller name
- Tracking information (conditionally displayed)
- Estimated delivery date formatting
- Carrier name formatting

## Configuration

### Email Settings:
The system uses the existing email configuration:
- `EMAIL_USER` - Gmail account for sending emails
- `EMAIL_PASS` - Gmail app password
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Used for links in email template

### Development Mode:
- Emails are simulated when `NODE_ENV=development` or email credentials are missing
- Full email content is logged to console for testing
- No actual emails are sent in development

### Production Mode:
- Real emails are sent when proper credentials are configured
- Email sending failures don't break the order update process
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Testing

### Manual Testing:
Run the test script:
```bash
cd backend
node test-order-shipped-email.js
```

### Integration Testing:
1. Set up a seller account and list a product
2. Set up a buyer account and purchase the product
3. As seller, mark the order as "shipped" with tracking details
4. Verify buyer receives the email notification

## Error Handling

### Email Service:
- Graceful handling of missing buyer email
- Fallback values for missing order data
- Comprehensive error logging
- Returns success/failure status

### Order Controller:
- Email failures don't prevent order status updates
- Errors are logged but don't break the transaction flow
- Maintains existing notification system as backup

## Security Considerations

### Data Validation:
- Email addresses are validated before sending
- Order data is sanitized in templates
- No sensitive information exposed in emails

### Access Control:
- Only sellers can mark orders as shipped
- Email only sent to verified order participants
- Uses existing authentication and authorization

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions:
1. **Order Delivered Email** - When buyer confirms delivery
2. **Order Delayed Email** - If tracking shows delays
3. **Email Preferences** - Allow users to opt-out of certain emails
4. **Multi-language Support** - Localized email templates
5. **Rich Tracking Integration** - Real-time tracking updates

### Template Improvements:
1. **Product Images** - Include product photos in emails
2. **Estimated Delivery Maps** - Visual delivery timeline
3. **Seller Contact Info** - Direct communication options
4. **Related Products** - Cross-selling opportunities

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Logging:
- All email attempts are logged with status
- Failed emails are tracked for debugging
- Performance metrics for email delivery

### Metrics to Track:
- Email delivery success rate
- Email open rates (if tracking implemented)
- Click-through rates on order links
- User engagement with shipped notifications

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables:
Ensure these are set in production:
```env
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-domain.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Database:
No database changes required - uses existing order and user collections.

### Dependencies:
Uses existing dependencies:
- `nodemailer` - Email sending
- `mongoose` - Database operations
- Existing utility functions
