## API Integration

The email functionality is automatically triggered when:
- Buyer calls the `confirmDelivery` endpoint: `PUT /api/user/shipping/orders/:orderId/confirm-delivery`
- Request body can include optional `rating` and `feedback`
- Emails are sent after successful database update

### Request Example:
```json
PUT /api/user/shipping/orders/60d5ecb8b4f4c2001f8e4b1c/confirm-delivery
{
  "rating": 5,
  "feedback": "Amazing product! Fast shipping and great communication from seller."
}
```

### Response Example:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "order": {
      "_id": "60d5ecb8b4f4c2001f8e4b1c",
      "orderStatus": "delivered",
      "deliveryConfirmedAt": "2025-09-03T10:15:30.123Z",
      "deliveryRating": 5,
      "deliveryFeedback": "Amazing product! Fast shipping...",
      // ... other order fields
    }
  }
}
```

## Database Changes

The implementation works with existing order collections:
- **Transaction** collection (for escrow orders)
- **StandardPayment** collection (for standard payments)  
- **Order** collection (for legacy orders)

### Fields Updated on Delivery Confirmation:
- `orderStatus`: Set to 'delivered'
- `deliveryConfirmedAt`: Timestamp of confirmation
- `deliveryConfirmedBy`: Set to 'buyer'
- `deliveryRating`: Buyer's rating (1-5, optional)
- `deliveryFeedback`: Buyer's feedback text (optional)
- `ratedAt`: Timestamp when rating was given
- `statusHistory`: New entry for delivery confirmation

## Testing

```bash
# Test delivery confirmation emails
